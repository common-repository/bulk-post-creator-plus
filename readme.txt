== Description ==

This plugin takes a simple list of titles and quickly turns them into draft posts or pages.  Modified from Sarah@HowdyBlog.com to be able to mass publish posts/pages. It's perfect for those times where you just want to brain-dump a bunch of ideas, or you want to build a skeleton of your blog to fill in later. This plugin really useful if you build some sort of automatic content generations.

That's really all it does; it doesn't have any fancy features. :)


== Installation ==

1. Unzip `bulk-post-creator-plus.zip` and upload the resulting folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Visit the `Posts` > `Bulk Post Creator Plus` area to use the plugin


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This is really basic. Can you add more features? =
It *is* really basic. There are two reasons for that:

1. I just needed something to quickly create a bunch of posts, and that's what it does. I am sharing it in case anyone else has the same need.
2. The current (and recent) versions of WordPress offer a lot in the way of bulk editing, and it seems more sensible make changes through that interface than to recreate it.

However, if you'd like more options (like categories, pages, tags, etc.), you might find that Wes Goodhoofd's [Mass Page Maker](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mass-page-maker/ "Mass Page Maker") suits your needs better. 


== Screenshots ==

1. Just enter your desired post/page names, one per line
2. The posts are created as drafts
3. The newly created drafts are available in the regular WordPress post/page management area
